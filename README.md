### Milestones
- M1 - Tally ca 1 mln Catalyst votes (as in compatible with Catalyst domain model) with min 3 and max 10 Hydra Head operators, perform distributed tally process and obtain only one result
    - ðŸŸ¢ Port Merkle Tree from Hydra to Aiken (https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blame/master/plutus-merkle-tree/src/Plutus/MerkleTree.hs) -> https://github.com/aiken-lang/trees/pull/1/files
    - ðŸŸ¢ Write simple on chain contract that counts votes
    - Run on chain contract counting unencrypted Catalyst votes with off-chain code
    - Hook up Merkle Tree to contract counting votes to attest if vote which is on chain is part of the tree
    - Perform final votes batch calculation merking all Merkle Trees together and giving a final result

- M2 - Using Partial Homomorphic Encryption tally the votes in such a way that each Hydra Head Operator cannot tally alone but all operators only can tally together


### Deployment
While overall goal is that anybody could tally but intially we expect that IOG / Emurgo / CF will tally the votes using Hydra Heads. The idea is that we want to avoid in initial versions having to pay and lock up people funds for slashing (in case cheating by the group was detected).

## General Open Problems / Questions
- Election: we would like to anybody could potentially run Hydra Head nodes but we do know that number of these people cannot exceed certain amount, e.g. 10
- M2: How split the key in such a way that each operator only gets a part of the key
- M2: How to count the votes together, in Hydra one operator needs to sign a transaction and all need to simply validate (full consensus)
- If we ever submit votes directly to Hydra - how to assure that one operator being temporary offline won't disturb the whole voting session, one idea, hydra can deliver n x m signing, meaning we can configure Hydra such that only ca 80% of operators need to sign. Unless voters directly interact with Hydra network - this is not really a needed feature.
- M2: Since Partial Homomorphic Encryption is CPU intensive, how can we actually run it in smart contract. Regardless of the fact that these are very resource intensitve tasks, right now there are no implementations for this available neither in Aiken nor in PlutusTx (to our knowledge)
- General: Once we open up the tallying to all people, how can we in a decentralised way select Hydra Head Operators doing the tally process? One idea is that we conduct voting on L1 and Hydra Head operators + backup operators receive ca 1 to 2 years licence, such a license such cover operation for a few Catalyst rounds but question is whether people will want to participate in selection of Hydra Head Operators doing the tallying.
